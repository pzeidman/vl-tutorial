# A primer on Variational Laplace
This code accompanies the paper "A Primer on Variational Laplace" by Peter Zeidman, Karl Friston and Thomas Parr. 

A standalone implementation of the algorithm for MATLAB or Octave can be found in /matlab/toolbox/variational_laplace.m . Note that the example code in /matlab/examples/ compares the output of the standalone implementation against that of the SPM toolbox, so SPM needs to be on the MATLAB path for the example code to run to completion.

Instructions:

1. Download the matlab folder to somewhere convenient
2. Using MATLAB or Octave, run examples/run_VL_all.m to reproduce the figures in the paper.
